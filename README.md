# Kia ora, Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

### About me
My name is Mere, I am a creative UI/UX designer and developer, born and raised here in Aotearoa.

I spent two years pursuing my design career in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Wellington. Originally, I spent the first two years after high school at the University of Otago, pursuing a Bachelor of Arts while trying to discover my passions and find my place in the world.

It was during these two years that I came to understand my true calling was in the design industry. Encouraged by family and friends to follow my heart and passions, I found the courage to change direction in my career and take a leap of faith.
